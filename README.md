# Text-Generation
This project explores the capabilities of text generation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. It involves training and evaluating both approaches on a similar dataset to understand their performance, strengths, and weaknesses in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

The goal of this project is to:

Build and train a character-level LSTM model from scratch for text generation.

Fine-tune or use a pre-trained GPT model (like GPT-2) for the same task.

Compare both models based on:

Output quality

Training time

Memory usage

Convergence behavior

Realism and creativity in text generation

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)

Hugging Face Transformers (for GPT-2)

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for evaluation & visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Features
📖 Custom dataset support for both models.

📊 Side-by-side comparison of LSTM and GPT outputs.

🧠 Simple implementation of LSTM-based RNN from scratch.

⚡ Easy switching between models for evaluation.

📂 Well-organized code and modular structure.

📊 Results & Observations
LSTM performed well on short-term dependencies but struggled with longer contexts.

GPT generated more contextually rich and coherent text, even for longer prompts.

LSTM had a simpler structure but required more effort in tuning.

GPT, while more resource-intensive, provided superior performance out of the box.
